# Agentic-AI-Intern
Data Science Agents: 10× Faster Analytics
I helped develop an AI Data Science Team – a Python library of specialized AI “copilot” agents that automate end-to-end data workflows. The team includes agents for data loading, cleaning, wrangling, feature engineering, visualization, SQL querying, and modeling (e.g. churn prediction, risk scoring)
By integrating LangChain/OpenAI with tools like  MLflow, our agents interpret natural-language instructions to perform tasks (merging tables, plotting charts, training models, etc.) and dramatically accelerate insight generation. 
As an AI Agents Intern, I built and enhanced key modules. For example,
I improved the Data Loader Agent to handle CSV/Excel/Parquet files and launched an EDA Tools Agent for automated data quality reports (missing values, correlations, etc.)
Using LangChain, I orchestrated a Pandas Data Analyst Agent multi-agent pipeline that chains our wrangling and visualization agents
